        I build systems, gadgets, and experiments that do not always fit neatly into one box. Some are heavy infrastructure such as event wallets and pop-up networks. Some are reflective such as Orbit, a relationship manager that helps you care for people without feeds or extraction. Some are playful such as spatial cameras and small devices that laugh with you. This page is a Bento of work in progress and work that already ships.
